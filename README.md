## Purpose

This code produces climate scenarios using CORDEX NetCDF files and observations. It also performs the following tasks:
- automated bias adjustment and statistical downscaling when producing climate scenarios;
- download of reanalysis data;
- aggregation of hourly data to a daily frequency for reanalysis data;
- calculation of climate indices;
- calculation of statistics related to climate scenarios and indices;
- generation of time series and maps.

At the moment,the script only performs these tasks at a station. Soon, it will perform these tasks on a grid.
